## Playing With Literals

And now we playing with literals, literals are constant value which is defining that value and write to stdout.

```literals.xvr

// literal integers
print 3;

// literal floating numbers
// using dot character not comma
print 25.3;

// literal string
print "wello Xvr, how are you today?";

// literal boolean
// true or false
print true;
print false;

// or you can using separator for readable
print(200_000_000);
print(3250_000);
```

> [!NOTE]
>  to write output xvr using `print` builtin function to stdout, `print` support with or without parentheses (round bracket)
