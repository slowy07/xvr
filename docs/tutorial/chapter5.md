## Playing with conditional

What if today was raining? maybe you using jacket or umbrella, but, what if today are sunny?, you maybe wearing short pants or using sunglasses. We can play it with conditional statement.

```
// let's we create some example
var today_raining: bool = false;

if (today_raining) {
    print("wear jacket or use umbrella");
} else {
    print("use sunglasses");
}

if (!today_raining) {
    print("use sunglasses");
} else {
    print("wear jacket");
}
```

`if` statement are keyword using for conditional are `true`, statement on block inside statement will execute and write to stdout, and if statement are `false`, `else` conditional are execute it.

> [!NOTE]
> print will support with or without parentheses (round bracket).
